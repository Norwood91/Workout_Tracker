# Workout_Tracker
A program designed to track a user's workouts, using natural language. Built using the Nutritionix API and Sheety. This program asks a user to input the work out they've done, then it'll make a post request to sheety which then, thanks to the Nutritionix API, uses natural language queries to take that user input and import it to a google spreadsheet for tracking.
